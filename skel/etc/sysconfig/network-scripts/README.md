This directory should contain all `NetworkManager` profiles needed by the iso.

The configurations should be in `ifcfg-${NETWORK_NAME}`
The secret keys should be in `keys-${NETWORK_NAME}`

Beware that these passwords will then be available from the iso and should not be treated
as private afterwards.
