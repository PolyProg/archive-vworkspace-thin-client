## Lorax configuration

Lorax is used to generate the iso, and thus creates the grub and syslinux configurations
needed by the iso.

We took the templates from [the official repository](https://github.com/rhinstaller/lorax/tree/master/share/templates.d/99-generic)
and modified them to remove unnecessary entries and options.
